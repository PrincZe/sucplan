**Project Context: HR Succession Planning System**
Background:
This is a Succession Planning Application for a government organization that manages Human Resources positions across various agencies. The system helps track and manage succession planning for key HR positions, officers' competencies, and their career development.
Current Process:

HR positions across agencies need succession planning
Each position can have multiple potential successors at different time horizons
Officers can hold multiple positions across different agencies
Officers' competencies are tracked using Proficiency Levels (PL1-PL5)
Officers undertake various attachments/stints for development

Key Components:
Positions Management
-Each position has a unique identifier (e.g., POS001)
-Positions belong to specific agencies (e.g., MOE, MHA)
-Each position can have:
  -One incumbent (current holder)
  -Up to 2 immediate successors
  -Up to 5 successors for 1-2 year horizon
  -Up to 5 successors for 3-5 year horizon




Officer Management
-Officers are identified by unique IDs (e.g., OFF001)
-One officer can hold multiple positions
-Officers have grades (JR/MX grades)
-Officers possess IHRP certifications
-Officers complete various stints/attachments


Competency Framework
-Various HR competencies (e.g., HR Business Partnership, Data Analytics)
-Each competency has 5 proficiency levels (PL1-PL5)
-Officers' competency levels are tracked
-Positions may require specific competency levels


OOA (Out-of-Agency) Stints
-Officers undertake various developmental stints
-Stints can be internal, external, or training-based
-Each stint has a completion year
-Officers can have multiple stints



MVP Requirements:

Essential Features:
View and edit position details
-Assign/remove incumbents
-Manage succession plans
-Update officer competencies
-Track officer stints


Must-Have Data Management:
-Position-Officer assignments
-Competency level tracking
-Successor assignments
-Basic stint recording


Key User Stories:
CopyAs an HR Manager, I need to:
- View all positions and their current incumbents
- Assign potential successors to positions
- Update officers' competency levels
- Record officers' stint completions
- View officers' career progression


Data Structure Context:
CopyExample Position:
POS001 (Director HC)
- Incumbent: Sarah Tan (OFF001)
- Immediate Successors: James Lim (OFF002), Priya Kumar (OFF003)
- 1-2 Year Successors: Michael Chen (OFF004), Lisa Wong (OFF005)
- Required Competencies: 
  * HR Business Partnership (PL5)
  * Data Analytics (PL4)

Example Officer:
OFF001 (Sarah Tan)
- Current Positions: Director(HC) at PSD, HR Director at MOH
- Grade: JR8
- Competencies:
  * HR Business Partnership (PL5)
  * Data Analytics (PL4)
- Completed Stints:
  * Private Sector Attachment (2023)
  * Cross-Ministry Project (2023)

Technical Considerations:
Database needs to handle:
-Many-to-many relationships (officers to positions)
-Multiple successor types
-Competency level tracking
-Stint history


Frontend needs to support:
-Easy successor assignment
-Competency level updates
-Position management
-Officer profile updates


Business Rules to Consider:

Position constraints:
-Max 2 immediate successors
-Max 5 successors for other timeframes
-One incumbent at a time


Officer constraints:
-Can hold multiple positions
-Must have valid grade
-Competency levels 1-5 only


Competency rules:
-PL levels must be 1-5
-Officers must have at least basic competencies
-Some positions require minimum PL levels
